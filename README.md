# [WLDragnet](https://talkliberation.com/wldragnet) Search
https://wldragnet.com

This project is brought to you by the team building [Panquake](https://panquake.com) and is an example of the strong ethical design and high-quality standard we bring to the software development process. It is released as Free and Open-Source Software (FOSS) in the interest of the public good.

In October 2021, [Talk Liberation](https://talkliberation.com/wldragnet) published WLDragnet - an investigation that included 1500+ reports and a repository of 7,100+ files that prove US military contractors and weapons manufacturers are utilizing open-source intelligence to track and analyze the social media conversations of persons, hashtags, keywords and topics of political consequence, effectively creating target lists.

This profiling spans from 2018 up to the present day and its scope continues to grow. Nearly 200 reports and 500+ files were added to the WLDragnet repository in February 2022.

Featured in the target lists are whistleblowers, journalists, activists, and thousands of regular citizens. The files can be onerous to manually search through and difficult to understand, so Talk Liberation created a more high-level and stripped-down view: the WLDragnet Search.

Talk Liberation encourages readers to independently validate this work and to develop it further. The information here is provided for context as well as journalistic and technical exploration beyond the scope of our initial investigation.

## App Overview

This repository contains an application that complements investigative reporting into [WLDragnet](https://talkliberation.com/wldragnet) and makes it easy for Twitter users to find out if they have been targeted and in what context. They can then click through to the relevant sources for the full picture.

The WLDragnet Search is a Flask application that displays results generated from the [WLDragnet files](https://talkliberation.com/wldragnet-repo). This repository also includes [utility scripts](filescan/README.md) for scraping the data and a DDL file for the required database structure.

## Installation and Configuration

### Dependencies
* Python 3.9
* Flask
* Postgresql12.6+
* Redis
* pip
* virtualenv
* psycopg2
* wkhtmltopdf
* poppler

### Docker Setup
```shell
docker-compose up
```
This will spawn three containers, `wldragnet_redis`, `wldragnet_postgresql` and `wldragnet_flask`. The application will then be available at http://127.0.0.1:5000/

In order to get data into the database, the folder `documents/` will be mounted as a volume to the `wldragnet_flask` container.
All PDF files in there can be scanned with
```shell
docker exec -it wldragnet_flask python3 /app/filescan/filescan.py
```

### Manual Setup
The application needs a [postgresql](https://www.postgresql.org/) and a [redis](https://redis.io/) instance
For testing and evaluation the`psycopg2-binary` library from pip can be used instead of `psycopg2` itself.

#### Preparation
1. [Download and install dependencies for psycopg2](https://www.psycopg.org/docs/install.html)
1. [Download and install wkhtmltopdf](https://wkhtmltopdf.org/)
1. [Download and install pdftotext requirements](https://github.com/jalan/pdftotext#os-dependencies) 
1. [Download and install Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-390/)
1. [Install pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installation/)
1. ```pip install virtualenv```
### Installation
1. Clone this repo
1. `cd` into the cloned repo
1. ```virtualenv venv```
1. ```source venv/bin/activate```
1. ```pip install -r dependencies.txt```
1. Connect to a postgres database and run the wldragnet-search-ddl.sql script to set up the database
### Configuration
Create a `.env` file in the project root folder and edit accordingly. These weak credentials are for local testing and should be changed in other scenarios.
